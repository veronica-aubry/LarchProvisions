From Western Culinary Institute graduate (2003) to Iron Chef America contestant (Beast, 2010) - Emily’s culinary trajectory has found her leading the kitchens of some of Portland’s best chefs and restaurateurs; including Gabe Rucker and Naomi Pomeroy, Tommy Habetz, John Gorham, Troy McClarty, and more.
